# Resume
Resume using HTML and CSS

In the index.html file, I have used HTML to create the page layout. In the left side, I have used five div blocks for various sections such as Contact, Skills, Language, Hobbies, and Image. In the right side, I have used five more blocks for various sections such as Name, Experience, Education, and Project.
In the resume.css file, I have made each element with a class name that is used to design this resume. For the left side div block, I have used class name (.left), and similar for the right side. I have used (.right) and set the properties background color & position. I have also used flex display properties in the body and grid for the full page.
